  "body": "## The only model you need at the start\n\nYou always produce ATP. The question is: **how fast**, and **for how long**.\n\n- **Very fast, very short:** phosphagen system\n- **Fast, short-to-medium:** glycolysis\n- **Slower, long duration:** oxidative system\n\n## Training implication\n\nMost endurance progress is: build aerobic base + add a bit of high intensity carefully.",
